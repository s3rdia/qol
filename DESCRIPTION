Description: The main goal is to make descriptive evaluations easier to create bigger and more complex outputs in less time with less code. Introducing format containers with multilabels <https://documentation.sas.com/doc/en/pgmsascdc/v_067/proc/p06ciqes4eaqo6n0zyqtz9p21nfb.htm>, a more powerful summarise which is capable to output every possible combination of the provided grouping variables in one go <https://documentation.sas.com/doc/en/pgmsascdc/v_067/proc/p0jvbbqkt0gs2cn1lo4zndbqs1pe.htm>, tabulation functions which can create any table in different styles <https://documentation.sas.com/doc/en/pgmsascdc/v_067/proc/n1ql5xnu0k3kdtn11gwa5hc7u435.htm> and other more readable functions. The code is optimized to work fast even with datasets of over a million observations.
